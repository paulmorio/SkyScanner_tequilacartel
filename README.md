SkyScanner_tequilacartel
========================

This is the README file for TequilaCartel's Project.

Update 1404: This is THE repository for TequilaCartel's project with Sky Scanner.

NOTE: The main webpage, as well as any of its files will NOT work until everything has come together, initial editions and layout can be seen on my(paulmorio's) computer.
Even when complete it will only work on machines that have all the necessary files as this website is not hosted on a server.

Simply for Re-iteration.
Aim: To have a webpage that can display the following (minimum):
	Title, 
	column with dates (or selected dates)/calendar, 
	and map showing possible destinations as a result of date decisions.
	
Implementation:
-insert here in the end-

License and Fair use etc.
-insert here after implementation is cleared up.
